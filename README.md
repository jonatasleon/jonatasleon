- 🐍 **Python**: My favorite language for developing **APIs**, **ETL processes**, and crafting scalable back-end systems with frameworks like FastAPI and Flask.
- ⚛️ **ReactJS**: Building intuitive and responsive interfaces with Redux, TailwindCSS, and MaterialUI.
- 🌐 **Web GIS**: Developing geographic information systems and data visualizations powered by **PostgreSQL/PostGIS**, spatial data, and tools like D3.js, Chart.js, and Matplotlib.
